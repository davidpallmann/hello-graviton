# Hello, Graviton!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Graviton!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-graviton) blog post. 

This episode: This episode: AWS Graviton and NET on ARM64. In this Hello, Cloud! blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular feature, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce AWS Graviton and deploy an ARM64 "Hello, Cloud" .NET function to AWS Lambda. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Graviton Project

We will create a .NET 6 function that performs temperature conversion, and deploy it to AWS Lambda to run on ARM64 Graviton processors.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
